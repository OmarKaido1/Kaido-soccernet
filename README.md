This repository presents my master’s thesis project on Football Event Detection using Multi-Modal Deep Learning Models, developed as part of the SoccerNet Challenge. The goal of this work is to advance automatic understanding and analysis of football matches by combining visual features (from video) and audio features (from commentary and crowd sounds) to accurately detect key match events such as goals, cards, and substitutions.

The project integrates advanced deep learning techniques, including ResNet and YOLO for visual feature extraction, VGGish and FFT for audio feature extraction, and a multi-modal fusion model to improve event spotting performance. This repository contains the full implementation, training scripts, and evaluation pipeline following the official SoccerNet benchmark.

This work is conducted as part of the requirements for the Master’s degree in [Your Field] at [Your University / Department], and aims to contribute to the academic and research community in the field of sports video analysis.
